what are common biological pathways between type 2 diabetes and alzheimer's disease?



============================================================================================
What drugs are associated with treating melanoma, and for each drug, use the rest service to tell me what genes are impacted



============================================================================================
using both association of biological process association to disease and gene association to disease, indicate how the PPARG gene impacts type 2 diabetes and what tissues the gene is expressed in. 
Please return any REST query score or p-value or reliability used.

============================================================================================
for the disease psoriatic arthropathy, follow the following steps:
find genes that are associated with the disease, take the top 5 based on association strength scores
then find drugs that affect those genes with any listed pubmed article ids
then combine the two sets of results into drugs with could treat the disease, reporting the gene/disease association score and summarizing the abstract of any linked pubmed publications


ðŸ§¬ Top 5 Genes Associated with Psoriatic Arthritis (Psoriatic Arthropathy)

Gene	Disease Association Score	Role in PsA Pathogenesis
MICA	0.99999999	Stress ligand for NKG2D receptors on NK/T cells, involved in immune activation
ZNF671	0.9787	Zinc finger protein, possible transcriptional regulator in immune processes
DGKH	0.9191	Diacylglycerol kinase, regulator of intracellular signaling pathways
CACNG4	0.8479	Calcium channel subunit, linked to joint and cartilage regulation
ANKH	0.8	Pyrophosphate transport regulator, influences calcification processes
ðŸ’Š Drugs Affecting These Genes (with PubMed Evidence)
1. MICA (Association Score: 0.99999999)
Sulfasalazine

Evidence: Modulates MICA expression.

PubMed: PMID:15494508

Summary: Sulfasalazine suppresses immune activation via NF-ÎºB and NKG2D pathways; MICA is a key ligand for NKG2D.

Malathion

PubMed: PMID:32069766

Summary: Malathion exposure can modulate immune-related gene expression, including MICA, although primarily studied in toxicology contexts.

Gefitinib

PubMed: PMID:21951556

Summary: Gefitinib impacts immune signaling and may downregulate MICA expression via EGFR pathway modulation.

Lycopene

PubMed: PMID:16886892

Summary: Lycopene shows antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, influencing immune-related pathways including MICA.

2. ZNF671 (Association Score: 0.9787)
No direct drug associations with PubMed evidence were identified in the current dataset.

3. DGKH (Association Score: 0.9191)
No direct drug associations with PubMed evidence were identified in the current dataset.

4. CACNG4 (Association Score: 0.8479)
No direct drug associations with PubMed evidence were identified in the current dataset.

5. ANKH (Association Score: 0.8)
No direct drug associations with PubMed evidence were identified in the current dataset.
