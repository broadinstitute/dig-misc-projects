- properties for edges to train on
  - beta_uncorrected for trait gene set, combined for trait gene




- process of data massaging
  - make all props of edges 'weight' column
  - remove edges with no weight
    - cat Factor_FACTOR_GENE_Gene_edges.csv | grep -v ',{}$' > Factor_FACTOR_GENE_SET_GeneSet_edges.csv


- data notes 
  - have factor/geneset edges with no weights
  - extra edges in graph
